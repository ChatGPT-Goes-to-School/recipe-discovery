# Recipe Discovery 

## Features

The Recipe Discovery repository is a part of the Recipe Discovery module, responsible for providing users with a variety of features to explore, discover, and interact with recipes. The repository contains the codebase and resources necessary to implement the recipe discovery functionalities.

The key features of the Recipe Discovery repository include:

- Recipe Recommendations: The system suggests personalized recipe recommendations based on the user's preferences, past interactions, and dietary restrictions.
- Popular Recipes: Users can explore and discover popular recipes based on factors such as user ratings, number of views, or trending ingredients.
- Recipe Collections: Users can create and manage their own collections of favorite recipes or recipes for specific occasions.
- Advanced Filtering and Sorting: Users can refine recipe search results by applying advanced filtering options such as cuisine, dietary restrictions, cooking time, and ingredients.
- Recipe Reviews and Ratings: Users can leave reviews and ratings for recipes they have tried.
- User-Submitted Recipes: Users can submit their own recipes to the platform for others to discover and try.
  
## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot: A Java-based framework used to develop enterprise-grade applications with ease.
- Elasticsearch: A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine used for efficient recipe search and retrieval.
- Redis: An open-source in-memory data structure store used for caching and improving performance.
  
## Getting Started

To get started with the Recipe Discovery repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local development environment.
2. Install the required dependencies and libraries specified in the project's documentation.
3. Configure the necessary connection parameters for Elasticsearch and Redis in the application properties file.
4. Implement the business logic and functionalities for recipe recommendations, popular recipes, recipe collections, filtering and sorting, reviews and ratings, and user-submitted recipes.
5. Run the application locally and test the implemented features.

Refer to the project's documentation and codebase for detailed instructions on setting up the development environment and running the application.

## CICD Workflow

The repository follows a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow. Changes pushed to the main branch are automatically built, tested, and deployed to the staging environment. After successful testing in the staging environment, the changes are deployed to the production environment.

1. Code changes are made and committed to the repository.
2. Automated tests are executed to verify the integrity of the codebase.
3. Code is built and packaged into a deployable artifact.
4. The artifact is deployed to a staging environment for further testing.
5. If all tests pass in the staging environment, the artifact is deployed to the production environment.

This CI/CD workflow allows for quick iteration and deployment of new features, bug fixes, and enhancements to the Recipe Discovery module.

## Cloud Architecture

The Recipe Discovery repository can be deployed on cloud infrastructure, leveraging the scalability and reliability of cloud services. The architecture may include components such as load balancers, auto-scaling groups, databases, and caching services. Detailed information on the cloud architecture and deployment options can be found in the project's documentation.
